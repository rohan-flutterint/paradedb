# Deploying Using the ParadeDB Helm Chart

## Introduction:

**Prerequisites**

- A Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- Helm installed. If not, please refer to the official Helm documentation for installation guidelines.

## Deployment Steps:

**Step 1: Add the ParadeDB Helm Repository**
First, add the ParadeDB repository to Helm. This repo contains all the necessary charts for ParadeDB.

```bash
helm repo add paradedb https://paradedb.github.io/helm-charts
```

**Step 2: Update the Helm Repository**

Update the repo to ensure you have the latest chart version.

```bash
helm repo update
```

**Step 3: Search for the ParadeDB Chart**

Before installing, you can search for available charts in the ParadeDB repository to ensure you're installing the right one.

```bash
helm search repo paradedb
```

**Step 4: Install the ParadeDB Chart**

Install the chart. You can customize the values using a values file or the `set` flag. Refer to the documentation for all values that can be set.

```bash
helm install my-db paradedb/paradedb
```

<Note>
  my-db is a release name you choose. It will be used to identify pods,
  services, and any other Kubernetes resources.
</Note>

## Uninstallation Steps:

If for any reason you wish to uninstall the ParadeDB deployment, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
helm delete my-db
```

Remember to replace my-db with the release name you chose during installation.
