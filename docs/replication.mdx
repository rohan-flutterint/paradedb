title: Logical Replication
---



ParadeDB supports Postgres logical replication to replicate data between two ParadeDB instances or between a Postgres instance and a ParadeDB instance.



## Replicating data between two ParadeDB instances

If you are using ParadeDB as your primary Postgres and would like to configure read replicas, you can use ParadeDB as a master-slave configuration

Here is an example Docker Compose file that sets up a master-slave configuration with ParadeDB:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  paradedb-master:
    image: paradedb/paradedb:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRESQL_USERNAME: myuser
      POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      POSTGRESQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres # Password for the superuser, required to install ParadeDB extensions
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_MODE: master
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_USER: myreplicationuser
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD: myreplicationpassword
      PARADEDB_TELEMETRY: true # Set to 'false' (or remove) to disable anonymous telemetry
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - paradedb_master_data:/bitnami/postgresql

  paradedb-slave:
    image: paradedb/paradedb:latest
    depends_on:
      - paradedb-master
    environment:
      POSTGRESQL_USERNAME: myuser
      POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      POSTGRESQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres # Password for the superuser, required to install ParadeDB extensions
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_MODE: slave
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_USER: myreplicationuser
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD: myreplicationpassword
      POSTGRESQL_MASTER_HOST: paradedb-master
      POSTGRESQL_MASTER_PORT_NUMBER: 5432
      PARADEDB_TELEMETRY: true # Set to 'false' (or remove) to disable anonymous telemetry

volumes:
  paradedb_master_data:
```





## Replicating data between a Postgres instance and a ParadeDB instance

If you already have a primary Postgres instance, for instance on a managed Postgres-as-a-Service provider, and would like
to replicate data to a ParadeDB instance to serve as a search and analytics node, you can use Postgres logical replication.
