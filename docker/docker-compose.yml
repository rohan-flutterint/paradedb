#
# This docker-compose.yml file is for production deployments of ParadeDB. It pulls the latest
# ParadeDB image from Docker Hub, which has all ParadeDB extensions pre-installed and properly configured.
# It is intended for hobby production use. Make sure to update POSTGRESQL_USERNAME, POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD,
# POSTGRESQL_DATABASE, and POSTGRESQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD before production usage.
#
# There are several other environment variables which can be specified here to configure replication, TLS,
# and a few other settings. They can be found here:
